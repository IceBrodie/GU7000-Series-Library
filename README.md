GU7000-Series-Library
=====================

About:
This project is for edits or reimplementations of the Itron GU7000 series VFD Arduino and similar libraries. This library set did not originally contain a license file or documentation so operation will be assumed to be under an as-is public domain status unless otherwise notified by Noritake Itron who are the originators of the original library however did not release it with license documentation.

Models currently undergoing physical testing:
GU7003 112x40 graphic VFD display

Goals of this project:
* To produce a viable and simple library for the Itron GU7000 and compatible VFD displays and other displays that use the same protocols.
* To make the libraries as efficient for microcontrollers as possible to allow fast adoption and simple implementation.
* To aid in demonstration of the display and it's related technology, as well as provide a viable system for use in hobby or commercial production environments.
 
Some public documents provided by Noritake Itron may be added to this repository temporarilly for documentation purposes only, when feasable, they will instead be linked to in URLs attached to this README file.

URLs of interest:
* http://noritake-vfd.com/gu112x16g-7003b.aspx - Page for specific display
* http://www.noritake-elec.com/commands.htm - Command list to serve as skeleton for this project

Unless otherwise stated, individuals participating in this project do not represent Noritake or Itron and the fitness of this library should not reflect on their products or services, merely our own ability to work with said products or services only. This library is presented "as-is" under an MIT license and as such should include the LICENSE file if redistributed.
